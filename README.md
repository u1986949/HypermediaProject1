Project Analysis: Information Architecture
The information architecture of the page has been structured to ensure an intuitive and easy-to-navigate layout. The content is divided into two main sections: the sidebar and the main content area, creating a clear distinction between personal information and other sections like education, work experience, skills, and languages. The sidebar includes personal details such as the profile picture, "About Me," "Ambitions," and "Hobbies" sections, which are relatively short and provide a brief introduction to the user. This is a logical grouping, allowing visitors to quickly grasp the personal background of the individual.
The main content area includes detailed information about education, work experience, skills, and languages. These sections are designed to present relevant details in a way that is easy to scan. The education and work sections use bold headings to highlight key achievements and roles, with additional information (such as institutions and job titles) listed below each heading. The skills section is presented in a list format for quick readability, while the languages section uses progress bars to visually represent proficiency levels. This structure ensures that users can easily locate the information they are interested in, while maintaining a balance between visual appeal and usability.

Project Analysis: Visual Design
The visual design decisions made focus on creating a clean, professional, and modern look. The color scheme has been carefully chosen to create contrast between the sections while ensuring readability. The left sidebar uses a dark background (#3b3b3b), which contrasts with the lighter background of the main content area (#E1DDDD). This color contrast emphasizes the structure of the page and visually separates personal information from professional details.
Typography plays a key role in maintaining readability and visual appeal. The choice of Kaisei Tokumin, a serif font, brings a sense of elegance and professionalism, with varying font sizes used strategically to highlight important headings and details. For example, the name and title in the personal information section are larger to grab attention, while the rest of the text is set at a smaller size for a clean layout.
The use of icons next to contact information adds a modern touch and helps users easily identify the type of information (phone, email, location). Additionally, the progress bars for the language proficiency section provide a visual representation of skill levels, making the content more engaging. The overall design prioritizes a balance between aesthetics and functionality, ensuring the page is both visually appealing and user-friendly.
